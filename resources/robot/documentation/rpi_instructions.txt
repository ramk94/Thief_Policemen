Step 1: Physical Setup

-power up rpi
-plug computer into rpi using ethernet cable

Step 2: host ip address

open a command prompt and type

ip addr

once you see that the cable you just plugged in has an associated ip address
(should be something like 169.254.x.x/16) then move onto the next step. just
check ip addr every coupld of seconds until you see it. You can even do 

ip addr | grep 169.254

in order to just look for what you want.

Step 3: ssh power

type in

ssh pi@169.254.80.62

and, when prompted for a password, enter: pi

congrats!! you are now sshed into the rpi

Step 4: (optional) install vnc server

download vnc viewer from realvnc.com: https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/

and install it. You may need to reboot at this point.

Step 5: getting a visual desktop

start vncviewer

go file->new connection

and enter the rpi's ip of 169.254.80.62 into the "ip address hostname"

fill in the credentials of
username: pi
password: pi

when prompted. Now hit "ok" or "accept" or whatever and you should now have
a new possible connection show up in your vnc viewer window. Double click it.

Congrats! you are now looking at a low resolution rpi desktop!
